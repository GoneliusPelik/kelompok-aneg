            Audi is a premium automobile brand originating from Germany, renowned for its innovation, advanced technology, and elegant design. Founded in 1909 by August Horch, the name "Audi" comes from the Latin translation of Horchâ€™s surname, which means "to listen." The company produced its first car, the Audi Type A, in 1910. In 1932, Audi merged with three other companies to form Auto Union, becoming one of the largest automotive groups in Germany. After World War II, Audi resumed operations and began producing vehicles with modern designs.
            Audi's logo features four interlocking rings, symbolizing the four companies that merged to form Auto Union. The brand is known for its clean, futuristic designs characterized by sharp lines, high-quality materials, and meticulous attention to detail. A significant innovation from Audi is the Quattro all-wheel-drive system, which offers superior traction and stability. The brand is also at the forefront of automotive technology, featuring advanced systems like the Multi Media Interface (MMI) infotainment system and sophisticated LED lighting technology.
